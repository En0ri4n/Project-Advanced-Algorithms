    "<br>\n",
    "For more than 30 years, the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emitions have become more and more of a concern in every business sector, but especially in the transport one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency) has recently launched a call for expression of interests to promote the execution of demos and experiments of new mobility solutions for people and goods, adapted to different kind of territories.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in fact, those new mobility solutions and new technologies linked to the transport sector in general, although cost-effective and cleaner than older ones, pose new challenges particularly in terms of resource management optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the team set up by CesiCDP, a structure already established in the field of Smart Multimodal Mobility, you know that the current objective is to win new markets with very attractive financing schemes in order to keep developing the team’s business activity. Therefore, CesiCDP took the decision to respond to ADEME’s call for expression of interest and focus its study on the management of delivery route. The structure will indeed try to find an algorithm that could calculate a route on a road network that allows to interconnect a subset of cities to each other and then to return to its starting point. All of this in a minimum of time and taking into account the expected traffic on each axis for the different time slots. The idea the to propose a method from Operations Research to generate a delivery route correponding to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic version of the problem have been outlined yet but you have been thinking that a more complex version of it could make it more realistic and get ADEME to look a bit more into it. You will then have to figure out some additional constraints to implement to the problem."

In the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), ACO is adapted to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for routing vehicles to serve a set of customers while minimizing costs such as distance, time, or fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we initialize the ant colony. Each ant will explore paths that visit each client exactly once, always returning to the depot before its closing time, and then continuing with the remaining deliveries. For our problem, each part of one path starting and ending at the depot will represent one truck. The ants will leave pheromones on taken routes, so the more a route is chosen, the more pheromones it will have. The choice of the next route to take for an ant is random, with a greater probability to take a route with a shortest distance or with more pheromones. After all ants finish a path, best solutions will be rewarded with more pheromones while others' pheromones will evaporate a little. In our case, we are still going to reset the pheromones at some point so we do not get stuck on a path. Ants will keep improving their paths by exploring them through iterations, giving us a final solution converging to an optimal one.\n",
